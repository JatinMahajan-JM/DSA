//Graphs -> Node with edges
//Heaps -> Parent and child formula (just an array)
//& PriorityQueue -> nodes with {value, priority}
//WeightedGraph -> nodes with {value, weight}
//dijkstra Algorithms -> Makes use of priorityQueue
//HashMap
//Trees, BinarySearchTree -> bst, the child on right are bigger than parent and left child are smaller.
//Stack, Queue
//Linked List - singly, doubly
